<p>Pluses: we do learn some teamwork skill and communication skill in the team project process. We were able to work together; we were all reliable and punctual for the group meeting. We Discuss question and allocated to each person.  We think teamwork and skill communication skill is important for the future career life especially for the undergraduate student. We think the better communication will reduce or minimise the conflict between the team member. Also, the teamwork skill is building our capability to working together.</p>
<p>Minuses: we don't have the project action plan and risk management. Therefore, we may be facing some problem in the team. Such as we have the ambition to achieve certain goals. But some member did not follow our action plan for the project.  first, Unequal Participation that while in a group some of the members may not do that much work, while others may work hard. &nbsp;Second, Time consuming:&nbsp;The whole process could take the time to making the decision while working in a group. <br>
