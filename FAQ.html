<h2 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

<p> This is a list of the questions most frequently asked by other hobbyists and beginner aquarists. If these answers do not satisfy, feel free to send an email via the contact page and we will post your question and answer </p>

Why is my aquarium water cloudy?


<p> Your aquarium water may be cloudy for a number of reasons, to begin it depends on the colour of the water. If it is a green then most likely you have green water, an annoying type of algae that is hard to get rid of, i suggest you keep the tank out ofdirect sunlight, do water changes and maybe buy a UV filter.</p>

<p>If it is a cloudy white this can be due to a few reasons. The most likely is you have recently set up this tank, what you are seeing is a bacteria bloom that will soon pass (anywhere from 1 day to a couple of weeks). This bloom or mini cycle can also happen if you change a large amount (say more than 50%) of the tanks water or if you wash the filter media. Try to avoid doing either of these things. Overstocking and overfeeding can cause a light haze, maybe reduce both of these. </p>

<p>It could also be dust from a new ornament you have put in, you may need to do constant water changes to get rid of this. Substrates like Fluorite can make the tank cloudy for the first few weeks but will clear up later on. </p>

How long should I leave my lights on?


<p>For a planted tank 8-10 hours a day will be more than sufficient. Be sure to keep the tank out of direct sunlight as this will only promote the growth of algae in the aquarium. Don’t leave the aquarium lights on for 24 hours a day, the fish and plants need to respire and rest. This would lead to the eventual death of fish and plants. </p>

Do fish sleep?



<p>Yes it has been proven that fish do sleep during the night. It is important to let them get there rest by giving the aquarium sufficient darkness during the night. If prolonged viewing hours are an issue, it is best to use lighting during day hours and then at night add some moonlights for added viewing time. Have a read of DIY Moonlights</p>

Will fish only grow relative to the tank size?



<p>This is a misconception that is not true. Larger fish will soon need a larger aquarium to be healthy and happy. Restricting them to a smaller aquarium may stunt the fish growth and result in physical deformities. Be sure to give the right environment each species of fish in the aquarium.</p>

<img src="images/fish-icon.png" width="50" height="50">
How long do I have to wait for my tank to cycle?



<p>You have to wait until the nitrite spike has gone and nitrates are starting to rise, for a new aquarium this will be anywhere from 2-8 weeks, it is very wise to wait for this to end, because if you add more fish at this stage it will only put more pressure on the bacteria and most likely kill your fish.</p>
